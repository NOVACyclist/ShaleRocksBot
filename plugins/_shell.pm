    ## Simple database storage/retrieval using "cookies". (probably a poor name)

    ##
    $self->cookie("favorite_album", "meddle"); # creates or sets, current nick's favorite_album to "meddle"
    my $album = $self->cookie("favorite_album");  # retrieves the value for accountNicks' favorite_album
    $self->deleteCookie("favorite_album");      # deletes the cookie with key "favorite_album" for this user.

    my $runs = $self->globalCookie("num_runs"); # get the total # of times this plugin has been run. Not nick specific
    $self->globalCookie("num_runs", $runs + 1);  #increment the counter.
    $self->deleteGlobalCookie("num_runs");  # delete this key

    $self->deletePackageCookies();  #delete all cookies this plugin has created. (that is all user cookies, all global cookies)

    ## Database access.  RocksBot calls a module's groups of data "collections". 
    ## Collections are stored  under PluginName : CollectionName.  You can have as
    ## many collections as you wish, but it's polite to stick to your own namespace.
    ## So PluginName:settings, PluginName:$nick, PluginName:log, whatever.
    ##

    # Load up a collection based on nick using the special __PACKAGE__ variable.
    # my $c = $self->getCollection(__PACKAGE__, $collection_name);
    # Example: my $c = $self->getCollection(__PACKAGE__, $accountNick);
    # Example: load all collections for this plugin: #my $c = $self->getCollection(__PACKAGE__, '%');

    # Add a couple records to the collection
    #$c->add(val1, val2, val3, val4, val5, val6, val7, val8, val9, val10)

    # update a particular record by row_id. Only the specified fields will be changed.
    #$c->updateRecord($row_id, {val1=>'bah', val6=>'boo'})

    ##  Timer Events
    ##

    #  command => '',           # Command to execute.  Use _internal_echo for saying things
    #  options => '',           # Options to pass to the command
    #  desc => ''               # Just informational, internal only. 
    #};
    #$self->scheduleEvent($args);


    ## CommandHandler will handle run permissions, but you may want to check if a user
    ## owns a particular data item before allowing him to update it. This is useful b/c it 
    ## allows people without accounts to use your plugin, but enforces account security for 
    ## people who do have accounts. Example, stick this before a block that does some updating:
    #return ("You don't have permission to do that.") if (!$self->hasPermission($nick));
    # There, you're asking if this person has permission to operate on data belonging
    # to $nick.  If $nick has an account, this will return 0 if this person isn't authed as that user.
   # If $nick doesn't have an account, it will return true, allowing anyone to operate on that
   # data.  See, maximum usabiliyt. All a person needs to do to protect their data from 
    # meddlin' is create an account.


    ## Run another command after returning from this plugin.
    ## CH will preserve the state of this object.
    ## Make sure you know what you're doing or this will end poorly.
    ## You should probably just delete this whole thing right now, you don't need it.
    ## See Sleep for an example of how to use this
    #$self->setReentryCommand($command, $options);

    ##
    ## Speak to the world.  You can return a string (single message, will be paginated) or an array
    ##  (multiple messages, each will be paginated if necessary.)
    return $output; # one message in $output
    #return \@output;   # multiple messages in $output
}


##
##  Settings
##  You can define settings for your plugin.  The user will be able to manage these
## settings using the -settings flag with any command in your plugin, or via the 
## plugin name itself.  
## Access these settings in your code like so: $self->settings('setting name');
## As a shortcut, you can also use $self->s('setting name').
## The settings function is a getter/setter, so if you (for some reason) need to 
## change a setting, you can use $self->settings('setting name', 'new value');
##
sub settings{
    my $self = shift;

    # Call defineSetting for as many settings as you'd like to define.
    $self->defineSetting({
        name=>'setting name',    
        default=>'default value',
        allowed_values=>[],     # enumerated list. leave blank or delete to allow any value
        desc=>'Describe what this setting does'
    });
}


##
## listeners() and addHelp()
##  Note: these functions will be called after plugin_init, which runs few times.
## 1: When the bot starts up, it will instantiate each plugin to get this info.
## 2. When an IRC user uses your plugin. (which is what you'd expect.)
## 3. When a user asks for help using the help system.
## What this means is that if you're doing anything in here like dynamically generating
## help messages or command names, you need to do that in plugin_init(), not getOutput().
## See Diss.pm for an example of dynamically generated help & commands.
## 
sub listeners{
    my $self = shift;
    
    ##  Which commands should this plugin respond to?
    ## Command Listeners - put em here.  eg [qw (cmd1 cmd2 cmd3)]
    my @commands = [qw()];

    ## Values: irc_join irc_ping irc_part irc_quit
    ## Note that irc_quit does not send channel information, and that the quit message will be 
    ## stuck in $options
    my @irc_events = [qw () ];

    ## Example:  ["/^$self->{BotName}/i",  '/hug (\w+)\W*'.$self->{BotName}.'/i' ]
    ## The only modifier you can use is /i
    my @preg_matches = [qw () ];

    ## Works in conjuntion with preg_matches.  Match patterns in preg_matches but not
    ## these patterns.  example: ["/^$self->{BotName}, tell/i"]
    my @preg_excludes = [ qw() ];

    ## Default permissions for these commands.  
    #   UA_INTERNAL         (A command that only the bot should run.  Mostly reentry commands.
    #  UA_ADMIN             (Admininstrators only.  Full control.)
    #   UA_TRUSTED          (trusted users - by default they can do a bunch of admin stuff)
    #   UA_REGISTERED       (registered users)
    #  UA_UNREGISTERED  (world)
    #  If you don't specify any permissions, UA_UNREGISTERED is assumed.
    #   Use PLUGIN to set the default permission for the plugin as a whole. All commands will
    #       then require at least that level of access.
    #  There's a hiearchy.  Each user level can do everything that the levels below them can do.
    #  You can restrict commands by flag using the flag parameter.

   # Example 1:
   #     only registered users may run commands in this plugin, only admin may run foo
   # my $default_permissions =[
   # {command=>"PLUGIN", require_group => UA_REGISTERED},
   # {command=>"foo", require_group => UA_ADMIN},
   # ]

   # Example 2:
   #     anyone may run any command in the plugin, only admin can use flag -god with command foo
   # my $default_permissions =[
   # {command=>"PLUGIN", require_group => UA_UNREGISTERED},
   # {command=>"foo", flag=>"god", require_group => UA_ADMIN},
   # ]

   # Example 3:
   #     anyone may run any command in the plugin, only bot owner can use flag -god with command foo
   # my $default_permissions =[
   # {command=>"foo", flag=>"god", require_users=> ["$self->{BotOwnerNick}"]} 
   # ]

   # Example 4:
   #  anyone may run any command in the plugin, only trusted users may use flag "super" with
   #     any command within the plugin, but make an exception for user cowbell and let him run
    #   the command too, even though he's not a member of trusted.
   # my $default_permissions =[
   # {command=>"PLUGIN", flag=>"super", require_group =>UA_TRUSTED, allow_users=>['cowbell']}  
   # ]

    my $default_permissions =[
        {command=>"PLUGIN", require_group => UA_REGISTERED},
        {command=>"some_command", require_group => UA_TRUSTED},
        {command=>"some_command", flag=>'someflag', require_group => UA_ADMIN },
        {command=>"some_command", flag=>'someflag', require_users => [ "$self->{BotOwnerNick}" ]},
        {command=>"some_command", require_group => UA_ADMIN, allow_users => [ 'cowbell' ]},
    ];
